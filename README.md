This is a terminal operating system clone. Terminal operating system's are 
complex and hunderds if not thousands of devlopers calloberate to build these magnificent systems to be used by multiple countries at ports. This app doesnt do termials operating systems's justice. I built this app to challenge myself and to 
get a better understanding of the system we were using at my company on a daily basis. This is a React.js and typescript web-based application. To simulate the daily operations of a terminal operating syste. Follow the steps below for a quick 
demo. This is a open source code project , so feel free to download the files
for learning or add your own ideas to the project. Happy Coding!
