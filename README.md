This is a terminal operating system clone. Terminal operating system's are 
complex and hunderds if not thousands of devlopers calloberate to build these magnificent systems to be used by multiple countries at ports. This app doesnt do termials operating systems's justice. I built this app to challenge myself and to 
get a better understanding of the system we were using at my company on a daily basis. This is a React.js and typescript web-based application. To simulate the daily operations of a terminal operating syste. Follow the steps below for a quick 
demo. This is a open source code project , so feel free to download the files
for learning or add your own ideas to the project. Happy Coding!

Terminal Operating System Teminology
1) Vessel
    A vessel comes and goes from a terminal based on a schedule delivering and collecting Units (containers).
    Units (containers) dry/reefers are loaded onto the vessel to either be discharged to a termainal or to be exported from a terminals.
2) Units
    Units also knows as containers hold goods to be delivered to a customer via the termainal. 
3) Unit History
    A Unit has needs to be tracked by it's history. Where was the unit first created, discharged and exported. Including the physical status of the unit.
4) History
    A search tab or page is used to search for specific units by there container number.

How To Use The App

1) Discharge Units
    On the vessels page with this route /vessels, one vessel is already uploaded for you to try out.
    Doublec clicking the vessel will display the vessels details. Click the simulate discharge button to 
    simulate the discharging of units to the terminal.
2) Viewing Units
    Upon simulating the discharge of units from the vessel, the units will be populated and can be viewed
    by going to the units route /unitsivew.
    This will display all the units discharged in the terminal. 
    Double clikcing the a unit will display basic units details for you to read only.
3) History/Search
    Upon simulating the discharge of units from the vessel, you can copy any unit number from /unitsview and
    search using this rout /history in the form provided.
Thats it, enjoy and feel free to download the source code for this app. Happy coding!
